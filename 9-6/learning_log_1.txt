#LL JavaScript Review
https://www.w3schools.com/js/
I studies some JavaScript concepts that I was not familiar with on w3schools. 
I reviewed JS objects and how to accessing/modify object properties. 
I learned some JS Math functions and knew some math constants to use. 
I understood a lot more about switch statement and its execution. 
Lastly I read about type conversion and knew to distinguish different types of data, especially with NaN, undefined and null. 
I think I was a little confused by constructor property and how it is used for.
According to the examples it is mostly used for checking the properties or say data type of a variable.
I was also suprised by the automatic type conversion JavaScript would perform and I think I would take caution when coding.
